# Shiny Measure

My personal fitness app. Hosted at [rupertmckay.com/shiny-measure](https://rupertmckay.com/shiny-measure).

All data is only held in localStorage.

## Developer Guidance

1. Install dependencies

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the app

   ```shell
   npm run build
   ```

3. Serve locally

   ```shell
   npm run start
   ```

## Deployment

Deployment is handled automatically via Github Actions.

Any update to the `main` branch will trigger a new build and deploy.
